The Bottomless Box is a simple tool that utilizes Local Storage to save information regarding your household items. It's primarily used for inventory management. 

There are nine "pockets," or genres of items that you can store:

Fruit
Vegetables
Junk Food
Food (general)
Drinks
Medicine
Electronics
Pet Supplies
Miscellaneous

Outside of using Facebook's React Framework, I've created all aspects of the bottomless box (including the art). If you have any questions or want to propose any possible features don't hesitate to reach out!
