The Bottomless Box is a simple tool that utilizes Local Storage to save information regarding your household items. It's primarily used for inventory management. 

There are nine "pockets," or genres of items that you can store:

1. Fruit
2. Vegetables
3. Junk Food
4. Food (general)
5. Drinks
6. Medicine
7. Electronics
8. Pet Supplies
9. Miscellaneous


The Bottomless Box was originally created as an inventory management system. However, I personally have almost exclusively been using it as an electronic shopping list. So, rather than keep it as it is or change it entirely, I added the shopping list mode. 

To switch from your inventory to the shopping list, simply press the shopping cart icon in the inventory button menu (to the right of the inventory).

As of September 29, 2019, I've implemented sales tax into the total value calculations. In order to set your city's sales tax, you only need to click (or tap) on the dark, rounded total field in the top right of the inventory box. The number to the right of the tilde (~) will be the total value of the current pocket plus the sales tax.

You can click the shopping cart icon in the "Create Item" or "Edit Item" popup to switch the item from a shopping list item to an inventory item. However, any item that you've depleted (aka - set the quantity to 0) will automatically be transferred to the shopping list.

Outside of using Facebook's React Framework, I've created all aspects of the bottomless box (including the art). If you have any questions or want to propose any possible features don't hesitate to reach out!
